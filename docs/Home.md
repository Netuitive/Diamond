Diamond is a python daemon that collects system metrics and publishes them to Graphite or other supported handlers.
It is capable of collecting cpu, memory, network, i/o, load and disk metrics.  Additionally,
it features an API for implementing custom collectors for gathering metrics from almost any source.
